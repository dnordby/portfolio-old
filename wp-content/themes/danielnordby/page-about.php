			<h1 class="h1 sm-bottom">I'm an NYC-based web developer. I build responsive frontend website experiences with talented people for ecommerce, lifstyle, and corporate brands.</h1>	
			<p>I love partnering with amazing clients and designers to bring their vision to fruition on the web. I've worked with a range of technologies that allow clients to achieve the results they're looking for, in ways that are intuative and flexible to manage.</p>

			<h2 class="xxs-bottom sm-top">What I Do</h2>
			<p>While anything is possible, I've discovered that can be a double-edged sword. I like to follow a few steps to keep a project on track:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Plan</span> - this phase considers comparable sites for best practices, scopes the project, timelines are discussed, and other preliminary strategy steps are undertaken to ensure the site is built on time and to specs.</li>
				<li><span>Create</span> - working with a designer and clients closely, pages are mocked up, the strategy is fleshed out in wireframse, color palates, fonts, and style are chosen.</li>
				<li><span>Produce</span> - this is the coding phase! Things sometimes feel like they start off slow, but setting the building blocks correctly early is key. Then the pages and site come together as a cohesive whole.</li>
				<li><span>Launch</span> - once the site has been built, tested, and approved, it is put into production.</li>
				<li><span>Refine</span> - things always come up along the way. If it's pixel-pushing, uncaught bugs, or a few changes here and there, I stay on the case for two weeks following the launch to ensure smooth sailing.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="xxs-bottom sm-top">What I Don't Do</h2>
			<p>Design - I partner with designers on projects because I didn't go to design school and I'm constantly amazed at the work that they are able to produce. I encourage looping in a skilled designer to ensure important design and branding decisions are made the right way.</p>
			<p>Don't worry! Once I have the approved designs I will work carefully and closely with the designer to ensure that the site matches the designs and everyone's expectations.</p>
