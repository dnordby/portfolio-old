			<h1 class="h1">Hey, I'm Daniel. I live and work in NYC. I build responsive frontend website experiences with talented people for ecommerce, lifstyle, and corporate brands.</h1>
			<p>I'm a finance transplant who decided to teach myself to code. Two weeks after I left finance I landed an internship at an amazing digital agency, Verbal + Visual, where I've been for the last 2 years.</p>
			<p>With V+V, I've developed my skills and been a part of a range of technology implementations for companies across a broad cross-section of industries.</p>
